                    Things fall apart
                    And time breaks your heart
                    I wasn't there, but I know
                    She was your girl
                    You showed her the world
                    But fell out of love and you both let go

                    All I could do was hold her
                    Only made us closer until July
                    Now, I know that you love me
                    You don't need to remind me
                    I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
