                        "Every Breath You Take" by The Police is a song about obsession and surveillance disguised as a love ballad. The lyrics describe a narrator who watches every move of someone, interpreting it as devotion, but it carries a darker tone of control and possessiveness. The haunting melody and Sting’s emotional delivery make it one of the most memorable songs about unreciprocated attachment.
