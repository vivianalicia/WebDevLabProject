                        "Every Breath You Take" by The Police is a song about obsession and surveillance disguised as a love ballad. The lyrics describe a narrator who watches every move of someone, interpreting it as devotion, but it carries a darker tone of control and possessiveness. The haunting melody and Sting’s emotional delivery make it one of the most memorable songs about unreciprocated attachment.

            [Verse 1]
            Every breath you take
            And every move you make

            Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
            I dream at night, I can only see your face
            I look around, but it's you I can't replace
            I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
            I keep crying, baby, baby, please
